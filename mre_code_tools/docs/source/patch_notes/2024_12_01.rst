Update: Dec 1, 2024 @ 9:06pm
============================

Bugfixes:

- Show reanimator choice event on govt change if swarm civic was selected after Mechromancy
- Fix number of starting districts for Mechanical origin, and balance the distribution based on initial resource demands from civics and traits.
- Fix tooltip issue in leader builder for Unrestrained Unit III being mangled by new triggers in triggered_self_modifier
- Robotist trait is not available anymore in leader builder (It should not have been there in the first place)
- GUI fix: Bellicose and Society Focus III are in the correct custom GUIs now (Thanks Krukal/FlantingCort for help identifying this)
- Some Voluntary Work bio-trophy jobs didn't know if the machine empire was catalytic; now they use food upkeep when appropriate.
- Disable "Synthetic Ascended" and "Mechanical Heritage" origins for AI because of an active bug/regression in the base game where Despicable Neutrals are generated for AI empires that start with a custom species class.

New content:

- New building: "Gardens" for Voluntary Work. A new job where Bio-Trophies leisurely tend their gardens, producing food output, improving bio-trophy happiness and adding a little bit of amenities output.
- Add a prescripted empire for Mechanical World origin start: Sanchusan Freebody Mechanism, a society of organic-skinned synths with emphasis on bodily autonomy and ascension
- Add a prescripted Machine origin: I95 Biocorrectors, former medical bots turned exterminator that reanimate organics into Machine shells
