=============================

- Bugfix: MAMP planetary decision failure logic was fixed, issue was an incorrect inversion
- Bugfix: Make sure all localisation files are indented by just 1 space. Remove stale localisation files.
- Bugfix: Disable MAMP Ascension Perk for Mechanical empires while the Mechanical version of MAMP is worked on
- Bugfix: Don't override rules about pop assembly. This was an oversight that broke things with other mods. I will make a patch for Merger of Rules to block MAMP auto assembly. In the meanwhile I added -1k pop growth on them. They don't seem to be auto-assembling but I'll still make a patch for Merger anyway.
