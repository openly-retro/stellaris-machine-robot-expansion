Update: Apr 26, 2024 @ 8:32am
=============================

- Bugfix: Don't show the repeatable World Machine tech until the non-repeatable version is researched
- New Feature: M.A.M.P. Frames. A series of projects and events to upgrade machine pops to a new species with 2x output, but 2x upkeep. They are built by planetary decision using existing pops. Have fun with this and please report your findings / feedback.
- Localisation files update: Copied English content to braz_por, french, german, polish, russian, simple_chinese, spanish, japanese, korean. Going forward every update to this mod will have localisation updates for all languages. I don't mean everything is translated but players who don't use English should see content, not just loc keys.
