==============================

- Show DLC requirements for certain traits in leader-building GUI
- Fix calculations on leader-building GUI, it should cost the correct amount now for however many leaders a player wants to assemble
- Fix tooltips for traits that are event-based
- Add special text for Upgrade II, the base description is somewhat confusing
- Show technology requirements on traits that have tech requirements
- Also add a bugfix to Merchant Machine where the player was getting double deposits for the trade route's value.
- Remove all Expertise traits from the core modifying GUI.. these traits don't have an effect on rulers :(
- Block switching subclasses in the core modifying GUI if a subclass is selected, this is to fix being able to stack on traits from another subclass, thus having too many traits
- Remove emotional support pet trait .. Some machines may provide emotional support, just not ones in these empires
- Do better filtering on which traits are OK for rulers and which are not
