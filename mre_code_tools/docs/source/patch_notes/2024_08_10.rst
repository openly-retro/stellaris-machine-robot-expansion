==============================

Special thanks to guest contributor Legit-Rikk! This update features two improvements that he has worked on:

- New feature: Added an adaptation of mute's "Extended Machines" mod, updated by Legit-Rikk. This introduces all of the content from that mod, including the "Overclocked" origin, the Machine version of "Overtuned". Pops with Overclocked traits have a chance of malfunctioning, as a downside to their powerful bonuses, meaning, a timed negative trait will be applied that has some maluses. Note that if you add mute's Extended Machines mod to your modlist, the version in Machine & Robot Expansion Continued will be deactivated in favor of mute's version.

- Feature improvements: Legit-Rikk has contributed fixes to the Merchant Machine civic, namely going through and fixing calculations, adding comments, all of which was a lot of work.

- Improvement: Machinery Tradition tweaked to permit Individualist Machine empires to use it.

Other updates (Retro):

- Traits from this mod are now sorted together
- All tech, traits, buildings, and APs have the text "<Machine & Robot Expansion Continued>" added to the descriptions to show what things are from this mod.
- Bugfix: Bio empires releasing vassals should not get weird hive/machine vassals due to events from this mod
- Bugfix: Mechanical World habitability trait can be used for any robot empire that picked the Mechanical World AP
