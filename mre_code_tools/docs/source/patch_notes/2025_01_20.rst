=======================

Added World-Machine Origin: A pop-less Machine origin focused on expanding using Auto-Machine Worlds.
- Includes pop-less replacements for a number of vanilla buildings, and adds unique buildings.
- The lore around Auto-Machine Worlds has been expanded a lot, with new flavor text for all the new buildings, updated lore for all the districts for CPU, Server, and Forge worlds.
- Players start with to-do items in their Situation Log as well as a "Databank" information-only situation log project that records important milestones over time, and contains starting lore to help players get a feel for the origin.
- Thanks to Legit-Rikk (help with world-machine upgrades code) Krukal and FlantingCort for Chinese language translations, and all machine & robot enthusiasts who weighed in with opinions and support.
