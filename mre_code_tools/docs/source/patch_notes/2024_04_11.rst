==============================

- Balance: Scaled CPU World machine research output from 70 to 30, to go along with recent research debuffs in base game
- Bugfix: Exclude Adventurous Spirit from ruler & councilor GUIs
- Improvement: Bio-Robot automatically inherits from Biological and Machine traits, so other mods' traits should be available for it now
- Improvement: Machine empires can make vassals after taking the "Distributed Multikernel" AP. Vassals will be fellow Machine empires. Not available for Determined Exterminators.
- New trait: "All-Terrain Hardening", 80% base habitability floor, with 10% more upkeep & housing usage, in advance of TMA
