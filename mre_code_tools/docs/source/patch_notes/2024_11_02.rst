=============================

- Bugfix: Destroy situation in situation scope, not country, when Protocol: Introspective reaches 1000/1000
- New feature: Machine empires with Assimilating Swarm civic and Mechromancy can reanimate defeated organic armies as undead armies (like the vanilla Reanimator civic).
- Thanks to Doves group for Chinese language updates
