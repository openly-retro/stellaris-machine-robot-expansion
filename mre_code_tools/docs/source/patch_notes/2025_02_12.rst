Mod version 2.4.2, Update: Feb 12 @ 10:26pm
===========================================

General Bugfixes

- Cooling district has been fixed on Auto-Ringworlds, very sorry that I missed it and it was an issue for as long as it was
- Auto-Ringworlds get colony designations
- Fix issue with Encrypted Protocol post-situation origins making empires unplayable in multiplayer

World Machine origin bugfixes:

- Orbital rings have been patched to be buildable on world-machines
- For empires with the origin, arc sites will show up on each homeworld if there are more than 1 empire with the origin
- Planet capital will get converted to auto-capital, automatically, when planetary project finishes
- Alternate version of planetary shield and military academy added for world-machines
- Added a decision for abandoning the colony "shut down world machine" (Nyawul)
- Help text added to WMC Fabrication decision, to tell players how long the actual process will take
- When a frozen/toxic/molten world has been transformed to be ready for conversion to a World-Machine, the popup message links to the planet now (thanks Legit Rikk for the code change)
- "Expand the Empire" event chain now completes. Run event oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_main.1100 in the console if yours is still stuck.
- Don't reset the auto-capital to tier 1 when finishing CPU/SER/ECU projects
- Fixed issue with decision text for Control Core Upgrade and Core Tap being unclear
- Show tech level of planetary core in info tooltip
- Fixed wrong economic categories being used when giving tech bonuses through the auto-capital to buildings and districts, which was resulting in overall district output being 20-40% higher than what it was supposed to be at
- World Machine Mastery tech will not appear as a research option (it was not intended originally to be researchable) but gets awarded for clearing 50 blockers, which is about 6-7 planets worth

World Machine gameplay tweaks:

- Add colony designations for auto-forge, auto-foundry, auto-research, and refinery, to Auto-Machine Worlds, and make these, plus other colony designations that make sense, available on Auto-Ringworlds. Automations are already present for these.
- Output of mining district and food district was balanced, and upkeep is raised slightly
- Resource production buildings (auto-buildings) don't have a science cost any more, but they do have science upkeep appropriate to the type of thing they produce
- Decision to start a World Machine with a core is compatible with Ringworlds and shows the target planet type in the decision
- Decision to start a World Machine will show extra text on frozen/molten/toxic worlds alerting players to the fact that there will still be some blockers there. I decided these blockers will still appear on these 3 planet types. I updated the tech description to reflect this, but I will keep the blockers there for now since these are planet types that have "extreme" conditions.
- Added colony automations for auto-ringworlds

New stuff (World Machine origin):

- Add info project in Lore Databank to show what planet classes can have WMCs deployed via decision, some will be displayed as ??? until players unlock them
- World-Machine specific versions of Orbital ring buildings have been added
- Can shut down World Machine colony with "Shut down" decision
- Can re-activate a world machine that's been shut down, with a planetary decision
- Initial support for Nanotech ascension -- farming & mining districts produce nanites, and there are automated versions of the Nanolab and alloys building; also, the lore text for the tradition has been updated to be more scientific, exploratory, and in a similar tone as the origin.
