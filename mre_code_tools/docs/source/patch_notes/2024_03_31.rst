=============================

- NEW: Councilor Editor GUI Feature. Edit gestalt nodes similar to the ruler modifying GUI. Add/remove traits with cost. Points and picks are tied to tech upgrades, uses the same tech as the ruler modifying feature.
- NEW: Technology to unlock the edict for launching Councilor Editor
- Localisation: Update all language folders with English content. I was sitting on this for a while, but it became necessary since the 3.9 version. Unfortunately this means losing the Korean translations that were a part of this mod. Will need a translator(s) to come and fix the rest.
- Bugfix: Added upgrade option to Planet Cracker to be able to dismantle it.
