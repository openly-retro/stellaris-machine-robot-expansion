=============================

- Bugfix/improvement: Fix too many cooling districts by applying offsets that negate the extra unintended bonuses, so it's not possible anymore to get a high world machine output bonus by destroying resource producing districts, when there are many cooling districts
- Limit cooling district bonus to 120%
- Bugfix: Remove 'towel' trait from leader-builder (that was unintended) and do a few other trait fixes
- Bugfix: Fix effects-based trait tooltips in leader-builder
- Bugfix: Fix not being able to add councilor traits that are given by a civic, so picking civics that give traits will work now
- Improvement: Flavor text addition to cooling districts
- Balancing/improvement: Add a mechanic for imposing output penalties to non-resource districts (like Naval Cap district) when the thermal throttling planet modifier is set to bad (world output is below 100% because there aren't enough cooling districts). This will help balance overbuilding non-resource districts.
- Add mechanic to prevent stacking non-resource districts in world machines
- QoL improvement: Add colony automations for each world-machine type, with custom icons for each. Now possible to automate building Generator districts on an Auto-Machine World, or Epsilon (engineering) districts on a Auto-Processor world, for example. Check out the new automations! Remember that open jobs must be 0 for the planet to keep building things automatically.
