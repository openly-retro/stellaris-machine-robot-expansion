- Bugfix: Dismantling Orbital Cracker was not properly clearing planet flags and deposits because there is no longer any mega scope available on_dismantle_complete so I re-introduced a "dismantle via upgrade" option for the Orbital Cracker so that players can dismantle it and have the planet properly cleaned up afterwards. This fix also supports dismantling multiple. You can still use the dismantle button that PDX built in but it will only be reliable if there is only 1 orbital cracker being dismantled at a time in a given system.
