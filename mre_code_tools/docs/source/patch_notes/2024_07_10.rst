Gameplay update: The MAMP ascension perk is now behind a country flag while it is being reworked behind the scenes to be more competitive with other APs. Thanks everyone for your feedback & patience so far. To playtest this AP, in the in-game console do:

`effect = { set_country_flag = oxr_mdlc_ap_mamp_enabled }`
