Planets and Districts
=====================

World-Machines
--------------

All World-Machines, except the non-specialized **Auto-Machine World Project** will overheat, reducing resource output on the planet, unless a **Cooling System** district is built to counteract the **Thermal Throttling** effect. The specialized districts of each type **do not require pops** to provide their bonuses.

Colonizable planets can be transformed into the four types of World-Machine, using a planetary decision costing 20,000 minerals, 200 influence. It takes 3600 days to complete.

Auto-Machine World Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An automated planet useful for producing raw resources.

- Auto-Generator Machine: Produces energy
- Auto-Mining Machine: Produces minerals
- Auto-Farming Machine: Produces food

Auto-Factory World Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An automated planet useful for producing secondary resources, like alloys, consumer goods, and rare resources.

Districts:

- Forge: Produces alloys
- Fabricator: Produces Consumer Goods
- Synthesizer: Produces motes, gas, and crystals

Auto-Processor World Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For your empire's research needs: a specialized computing planet.

- Circuit Unit Pi: Produces physics research
- Circuit Unit Sigma: Produces society research
- Circuit Unit Epsilon: Produces engineering research

Auto-Server World Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A world specialized for handling administrative overhead

- Drive: Produces unity.
- Router: Produces Logistics
- Firewall: Empire-wide deviancy -5 per district

Auto-Ringworld
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A more powerful version of a Ringworld.

- R&D District: Support producing either Unity, or Research
- Industrial District: Produce Alloys or Consumer Goods
- Raw Resource district: Produce Food, or Energy

Colony designations
-------------------

Each world-machine type has several colony designations available, set up generally to help players focus on stacking a particular resource. There are also "standard" automation settings for each world-machine, which will build districts fairly evenly, including cooling districts.

Using the colony automations with auto-machine worlds is a great quality-of-life improvement for players who don't want much planetary micromanagement.

*As of Phoenix 4.0 the colony automations don't work anymore sadly, we have to wait for Paradox to fix this in the base game*

Mechanical Worlds
-----------------

**Robotic species or Synthetic Ascended origin only**

The Mechanical World is a terraforming option, not a decision like the auto-machine world project. Once terraformed, the Mechanical world provides new districts, and job slots.

- City District: Provides housing, clerk jobs, improves ruler pop resource output by 1%, improves specialist pop resource output by 1%
- Generator District: provides housing, technician jobs. Improves energy credits from technicians by 1%
- Mining District: Provides housing, mining jobs. Improves minerals from miners by 1%
- Agriculture district: Provides housing, farming jobs. Improves food from farmers by 1%

Virtual Reality Server
----------------------

**Available for the Mechanical origin (Utopia)**

The Virtual Reality server converts pops into planetary trade value by way of virtualisation.
Additionally, the planet has districts for boosting empire-wide amenities, entertainment, and other bonuses.

- Primary District: Produces Trade
- Secondary districts: Research, Unity, Amenities
