Planets and Districts
=====================

World-Machines
--------------

All World-Machines, except the non-specialized **Auto-Machine World Project** will overheat, reducing resource output on the planet, unless a **Cooling System** district is built to counteract the **Thermal Throttling** effect. The specialized districts of each type **do not require pops** to provide their bonuses.

The planet can be automated using a planetary decision costing 20,000 minerals, 200 influence, and takes 3600 days to complete.

Auto-Machine World Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Auto-storage: Improved housing district, provides amenities.
- Auto-Generator Machine: Produces energy
- Auto-Mining Machine: Produces minerals
- Auto-Farming Machine: Produces food

Auto-Factory World Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Districts:

- Forge: Produces alloys
- Fabricator: Produces Consumer Goods
- Synthesizer: Produces motes, gas, and crystals

Auto-Processor World Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Circuit Unit Pi: Produces physics research
- Circuit Unit Sigma: Produces society research
- Circuit Unit Epsilon: Produces engineering research

Auto-Server World Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Drive: Produces unity.
- Router: Increases administrative capacity by +90 (which helps counteract empire sprawl size)
- Firewall: Empire-wide deviancy -5 per district

Auto-Ringworld
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Has automated versions of the standard Ringworld districts

Colony designations
-------------------

Each world-machine type has several colony designations available, set up generally to help players focus on stacking a particular resource. There are also "standard" automation settings for each world-machine, which will build districts fairly evenly, including cooling districts.

Using the colony automations with auto-machine worlds is a great quality-of-life improvement for players who don't want much planetary micromanagement.


Mechanical Worlds
-----------------

**Robotic species or Synthetic Ascended origin only**

The Mechanical World is a terraforming option, not a decision like the auto-machine world project. Once terraformed, the Mechanical world provides new districts, and job slots.

- City District: Provides housing, clerk jobs, improves ruler pop resource output by 1%, improves specialist pop resource output by 1%
- Generator District: provides housing, technician jobs. Improves energy credits from technicians by 1%
- Mining District: Provides housing, mining jobs. Improves minerals from miners by 1%
- Agriculture district: Provides housing, farming jobs. Improves food from farmers by 1%

Virtual Reality Server
----------------------

Available for the Mechanical origin (Utopia)

The Virtual Reality server converts pops into planetary trade value by way of virtualisation. Additionally, the planet has districts for boosting empire-wide amenities, entertainment, and other bonuses.
