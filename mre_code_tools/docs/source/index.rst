Machine & Robot Expansion: Continued documentation
==================================================

This mod is a continuation of XVCV's "Machines & Robot Expansion" , which is/was loved by many. A great addon for Machine empire enthusiasts which I loved playing. This continuation is by me, "Openly Retro"


Unfortunately, since XVCV has left the Stellaris modding scene, the M&RE mod became unsupported. The original mod by XVCV can be found here. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441507863 

This adaptation/continuation will continue to make the Machine & Robot Expansion compatible with the latest versions of Stellaris. In addition to bug fixes, new things are being planned!
