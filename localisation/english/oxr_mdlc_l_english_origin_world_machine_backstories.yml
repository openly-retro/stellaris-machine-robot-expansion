 ## PART 1
 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_squatters_backstory_part_1: "Originally we were a transport convoy, specializing in moving whatever a client wanted, no questions asked. We had quite a number of fighter squadrons in the beginning, comparable to the Belladonax Reavers, and we were strictly neutral. We could park pretty much anywhere, but some empires liked to give us a little trouble while we were in their space.\n\nSo, business was good. I mean it was really good. Credits flowing in, making a name for ourselves, got a side hustle going knocking around a few space pirates, collecting bounties. The stars were the limit.\n\nBut in the end, the megacorps got us. CareCorp. They didn't blow us out of the sky, I mean they started taking our business. I just couldn't figure out what would this corp want, who's raking in billions, why would they care about some small fry like us?\n\nI had to wrack my brain, we were checking all our contacts, trying to figure out maybe we crossed somebody along the way, maybe we melted some ships we shouldn't have. Meanwhile I'm trying to figure this out, our pilots start dropping. Walking off, no explanation, just leaving their ships behind. I thought we had loyalty, but I guess when you can print your own credits, well."
 # Option 3: Let them have the tech. We will re-invent it once more.
 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_squatters_backstory_part_1_response_3: "All's fair in commerce and war. We got what we needed with our own strength. Appreciate you recognizing that. If you need us to point our cannons at someone you don't like, hail us on our frequency.\n\n<Slag and Blade mercenary fleets are available for hire>"
 # Option 2: Terminate communications and take what's ours. This is their reply:
 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_squatters_backstory_part_1_response_2: "We don't have a lot of munitions left, but it might just be enough to get what we want.\n\n<Slag and Blade declare war!>"
 # Option 1: Continue communications: "You will continue your monologue."
 ## PART 2
 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_squatters_backstory_part_2: "Myself and about 50 other pilots, we formed a fleet, started doing hit-and-runs on CareCorp. They tried tracking us but we kept changing our paint, changed our callsign frequencies, even tweaked our engine signatures constantly so they wouldn't be able to sniff us out. We were good, I mean really good, but .. heh. They never ran out of money. We ran out fast..\n\nWe tried laying low for a while, charge up the coffers, but one day .. I'll never forget it .. we walked right into them. They were all cloaked. Didn't even see them. They shredded us.. we got melted, bad. Crash-landed on this planet, I thought that was it.\n\n"
 # Option 2: Terminate communications. This is their reply:
 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_squatters_backstory_part_2_response_2: "You have pretty good attention spans. Hope you'll use that in the upcoming battle.\n\n<Slag and Blade declare war!>"
 # Option 1: Continue communications: "You will continue your narrative."
 ## PART 3
 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_squatters_backstory_part_3: "You know as well as I do what we landed on was a World-Machine, much like yours. We didn't know at first. We just squatted, mined by hand, eked out a living. We were all pretty defeated. Then we found we could run one of the districts on auto-pilot, just plug it into a power source and give it some basic instructions. Then we started digging even more. Furnaces. Mines. Rare resources. It was a jackpot. You bet we gave ourselves a hand up.\n\nGood thing CareCorp didn't think to check twice if we were dead.\n\nBut the difference between your planet and ours is the core's busted, so we can only get this thing partially working. We need the tech to build another core and get the whole thing back up and running. And don't take it personally, but we didn't think you'd be quite willing to share your secrets for creating basically self-running machine planets. So we did what we did and got what we needed."
 # Option 2: Terminate communications, take what's ours. Their reply:
 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_squatters_backstory_part_3_response_2: "To survive you gotta be able to come up with creative solutions to life's big problems. I'll give you credit for figuring out how to rebuild the heart of an automated planet. And you'll give us credit for our survival skills.\n\n<Slag and Blade remain neutral, but keep the tech>"
 # Option 1: Continue communications: "You will continue your story."
 ## PART 4
 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_squatters_backstory_part_4: "Well there's nothing much else to say. Are you gonna take this personally and come hunting for our positronic brain-cases?"
 # Option 1: Let them have the tech. We will rediscover it
 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_squatters_backstory_part_4_response_1: "That is rather civilized of you. CareCorp would have tried to smoke us as soon as we lit up on their scanners. Our services are at your disposal. Oh, and here's a small something from us, consider it a trade.\n\n<Slag and Blade are our allies. We can hire ships from them. They left us a small fleet>"
 # Option 2: Terminate communications: take what's ours. Their reply:
 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_squatters_backstory_part_4_response_2: "I was beginning to think from your attitude that we might have been able to form a partnership. It seems we need to defend ourselves from you.\n\n<Slag and Blade declare war!>"
 # Option 3: Take what you need, but give us back the tech when you're done. Cost: 5000 Influence: 50
 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_squatters_backstory_part_4_response_3: "I don't know about that. I think you might need to tell that me again, in credits. Ah very nice. Well, you'll hear from us again in about 20 years. I promise.\n\n<Slag and Blade are our allies. We can hire ships. We get the tech back in 20 years.>"
 # Option 4: Give us back the tech, and we'll build you a new world core for free. Cost: 5000 Influence: 100
 oxr_mdlc_origin_world_machine_squatters_backstory_part_4_response_4: "Now that is an interesting proposal. But if you don't deliver a core in 10 years, we'll be back at your homeworld and next time might just help ourselves to a planet or two."
