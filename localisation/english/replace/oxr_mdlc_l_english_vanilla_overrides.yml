 ai_outlawed_short_desc:0 "These mechanical forms have had their sapience stripped away by their biological controllers, reducing them to servile robots."
 ai_outlawed_desc:8 "Intelligent, self-aware mechanical life is an incalculable threat to all biological life. The creation of a true sapient intelligence is an offense punishable by death.\n\n§EMechanical life-forms have their free will removed and are unable to perform £pop_cat_ruler£ §Y$pop_cat_ruler$ Jobs§! and more complex £pop_cat_specialist£ §Y$pop_cat_specialist$ Jobs§!.\n\nSapient AI Assistants will automatically be disassembled.\n\nSapient Combat Computers may not be researched.§!"

 ai_servitude_short_desc:0 "These mechanical life-forms are held in absolute servitude to their biological controllers, and can be used or discarded at their whim."
 ai_servitude_desc:9 "The overriding purpose of any machine must be to serve its masters and perform whatever tasks it was designed for, regardless of how advanced its positronic brain may be.\n\n§ERobot Pops have limited free will, improving their resource output but preventing them from working in £pop_cat_ruler£ §Y$pop_cat_ruler$ Jobs§!§!."
 ai_full_rights_name:0 "Mechanical Citizen Rights"
 ai_full_rights_desc:6 "Any self-aware machine must be regarded as an individual with all the rights and obligations that entails.\n\n§ERobot Pops are given full citizen rights and will thus use §Y£consumer_goods£ $consumer_goods$§!.\n§!"
 ai_full_rights_short_desc:0 "These mechanical life-forms have been given full citizenship and the right to self-determination as equal members of society."
 feature_robots:0 "Robot Workers"
 feature_robots_desc:1 "Robots are relatively simple machines, capable of accepting verbal commands but possessing no true intelligence of their own.\n\n§EWith the §Y$tech_robotic_workers$§! technology, Robot Pops are only capable of £pop_cat_worker£ §Y$pop_cat_worker$ Jobs§!.§!"
 feature_droids:0 "Pre-programmed Personalities"
 feature_droids_desc:1 "Droids are a more complex variant of robot, often coming with limited self-awareness and pre-programmed personalities to better serve their masters.\n\n§EWith the §Y$tech_droid_workers$§! technology, Robot Pops are now also capable of £pop_cat_specialist£ §Y$pop_cat_specialist$ Jobs§!.\n\nSome complex £pop_cat_specialist£ §Y$pop_cat_specialist$ Jobs§! such as £job_researcher£ §YResearch§! can only be performed if AI is not outlawed.§!"
 feature_synths:0 "Positronic Robots"
 feature_synths_desc:1 "Synthetics are very complex machines. Their positronic brains are capable of supporting a class-7 artificial intelligence, making them fully self-aware.\n\n§EWith the §Y$tech_synthetic_workers$§! technology, Robot Pops are affected by £happiness£ §YHappiness§! and can potentially perform all types of £job£ §YPop Jobs§!.\n\n£pop_cat_ruler£ §Y$pop_cat_ruler$ Jobs§! can only be performed if the §YFull AI Rights§! policy is active.§!"
