 # N-dimensional Manifestation -- we are analyzing patterns of how other dimensions outside space and time can manifest in our 3rd-dimensional space. A breakthrough here could mean giant leaps in space travel, materials transportation, production, and who knows what else
 # Fractal city design -- pattern makes transportation of resources more efficient
 # Fractal image coding -- lossy image compression
 # Fractal star maps -- using non-integer numbers between 1 and 2 to describe common characteristics of planetary bodies and other space objects. because fractals are "rough" and not exact, we can map the stars faster but at lower resolution

 # Infinite perimiter, finite space
 # fractal antenna -- pick up more frequencies, but not as well as antenae specifically designed for certain frequencies
 # 'small parts that look like the whole', that's a fractal
 # continual subdivision of edges 
 # In the visualization of a fractal number set (mandlebrot) are 'little copies of the original shape'
 # it's possible to have shapes whose dimension is a positive real number (nt just integer)
 # how does the mass of the shape change as it is scaled
 # fractal is not 1-dimensional nor 2-dimensional
 # electrons behave differently depending on the "dimension" they are configured in because of the way their charges pull on each other -- 1D: linear, 2d: plane, 3d: cube

 # Topology + Living Metal (insert name here): living metal can be printed into several shape archetypes ajd be continuously deformed into complex shapes for construction. [construction speed ++]

However, the charge controllers that monitor input from a generator district's solar arrays have been damaged during construction.\n\nIn order to expand the planet's energy generation capabilities, we will have to dedicate resources to analysing and repairing the controllers. The electrical engineering principles used here are not outside of our grasp, but the practical application is, at least at this scale and for this purpose."

We don't know how far down it goes or what other anomalies we'll encounter digging it out."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.25.desc: "We finished surveying the situation. The biomass was entrenched approximately ten meters deep. In one area it had leaked down into the flooring superstructure but did not cause significant damage.\n\nThere was a deposit of biomass that had not calcified, and our engineers were able to recover a portion of it.

 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.30.name: "$oxr_mdlc_world_machine_flooded_borehole_site$"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.30.desc: "It appears that during World Machine construction, the automated logic maps out ideal locations for mining boreholes based on the topology of the planet being transformed. To prepare sites for mining, the area is flattened and automatons dig in a large concentric circle to expose minerals, before then starting a large vertical mining shaft at the bottom.\n\nIn this instance, the process struck an unexpected underground spring and the site became waterlogged. If there is any World Machine logic to handle this sort of situation, it did not activate.\n\nTo get this site ready for mining district expansion, we have to drain the site, plug the spring, and clear various construction debris."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.35.desc: "We were able to drain the borehole and clear the debris.

 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.40.name: "$oxr_mdlc_world_machine_clogged_furnace_discharge_site$"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.40.desc: "Part of World Machine infrastructure are massive furnaces, which are responsible for providing smelting-level heat to industrial districts for processing ores into alloys. The furnace assembly process appears to occasionally present a defect during manufacturing of the flue gas stack in which the damper, responsible for regulating pressure differences between air intake and exit, does not properly seal the flue.\n\nIt appears that in rare cases, during automated test runs of completed furnaces, the fire escapes containment and ends up melting various components and sections, thus clogging the furnace and blocking expansion of industrial districts. Why this does not trigger a rebuild is beyond our current understanding."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.45.desc: "Industrial furnaces in World Machines are relatively simple, mechanically speaking, compared to other processes on the planet. It was not overly complex to remove components damaged by fires and recreate them. It was, however, time-consuming; since these furnaces are not meant to be disassembled once put together, the repair process is not the same for each furnace and our engineering node processors have had to come up with different re-assembly techniques depending on the scenario.\n\nRepairs range from simple bolts to arc welding seams from within the burning chambers, which often means being forced to leave equipment behind that will ultimately be torched when the furnaces re-activate."

 ## Housing

 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.50.name: "$oxr_mdlc_world_machine_irradiated_drone_storage_site$"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.50.desc: "Automatons are stored in unremarkable conditions. The storage slots run in a series and up to a dozen storage slots are found grouped together, generally. Automatons are used for a variety of tasks and are pre-programmed with the routine that they are to perform. Once the task is complete, automatons return to their storage slot to recharge batteries, receive any repairs, and get reprogrammed for the next task.\n\nIt appears the structural foundation for several automaton storage bays has been contaminated with superheated gel commonly used for heat transfer around the planet. If a region of the planet does not have functioning automaton storage bays nearby, the World Machine construction protocol will refuse to expand additional districts. Cleanup of the gel will be required, and the leak must be examined and repaired."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.55.desc: "After scrubbing the automaton storage clean, our engineering crews moved the unpowered automatons on standby back into their slots. The automaton shells themselves did not appear to be damaged.\n\nThe liquid coolant leak fortunately did not seem to be gushing uncontrolled; the plumbing ended up being crushed and creating a tight seal. A replacement for the destroyed coolant transfer tube was manufactured using slightly stronger materials than in the original design. Stress tests are returning ordinary results."

 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.60.desc: "A meteor shower occurred in the area designated for district expansion after automated processes created zoning for it. There do not seem to be any programming or damage control protocols for this type of event. The impacts are significant enough that the automatons which roll out to do a pre-construction inspection report a 'failure' status, and seem to get stuck in a loop."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.65.desc: "The meteors turned out to contain fragments of iron fused together with another type of material. There was sufficient debris for it to be cost-effective to expose the meteor chunks to high temperatures in order to melt off the metal.

 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.70.name: "$oxr_mdlc_world_machine_collapsed_transportation_hubs_site$"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.70.desc: "The transportation hub is a multi-level complex with many entry points that is key to moving things around on the planet. Large powered tubes ferry big pieces of cargo such as structural components, shipping containers of raw materials; smaller tubes move automaton-sized things around. There is a central mag-lev rail that automatons load and unload constantly; the train zips around at high speed between transportation hubs.\n\nOne of the upper platforms has collapsed onto the central railway. It is not immediately obvious why this happened. As a result the entire hub has been automatically disconnected from the rest of the planet and is preventing district expansion."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.75.desc: "The first stage of repair involved erecting support structures in order to raise up the fallen parts of the structure. Where necessary, damaged supports were replaced with new ones. The automatons seem to follow paths that provide electric charge from beneath; we were able to replicate this simple type of wireless charging capacity and had no trouble restoring the smaller pathways. In fact as soon as certain paths were repaired, shipping began to be resumed in those areas.\n\nRestoring the central maglev was not technically challenging but as soon as power began to flow through the rail again, a train immediately came through. We had to manually stop it unti our construction drones could certify that the rail was stable."

 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.80.name: "$oxr_mdlc_world_machine_exposed_structural_chasms_site$"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.80.desc: "Where there should be solid ground, instead is a chasm, most likely the result of an undiscovered sinkhole or other geological instability. The terraforming process should have braced the area and laid frames to create a solid district foundation, but instead simply skipped adding any sort of ground here.\n\nEngineering Research drones have compiled a report indicating an occasional race condition in the terraforming subroutine specifically addressing chasms that eventually times out and cause the templating process to skip this area. We will have to carefully rebuild layers of missing subterranean supports."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.85.desc: "Construction drones laid out simples structural lattices using common metals and filled in the chasm with geological debris from other areas. Gaps in the foundation have been laid out by injecting stone mortar and finished with chemical welding. The result is a smooth building area with default service ports for energy, data, and wastewater."

 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.90.desc: "When this site was selected for expansion, there was a mapping error, as on further inspection, the ground is not level and will cause the expansion program to halt, which is what happened. There are large dense outcroppings of rock which for some reason did not light up on the automated ground radar used to analyze flat land for density. The excavation team has reported large grooves and scrapes in the rocks protruding from the earth, and broken drills nearby, no doubt a result of the attempt to flatten the land with tools and equipment of sufficient strength.\n\nOur choice is to either update the World Machine's databanks with new information and relocate the designated district expansion area, or use explosive charges to finish leveling the area."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.90.a: "Relocate the district expansion site."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.90.b: "Apply explosives and finish leveling the area."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.95.a.desc: "The excavation team sent the district relocation request which was served by both a cognitive node and coordinator node. The planet's geography and topology databanks were updated with the new information."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.95.desc: "The excavation team sent the demolitions request which was served by two maintenance drones. New equipment had to be requisitioned temporarily for the work, which was completed without issues. The designated area is now ready for district expansion."

Interestingly, the router is not completely digital, and has redundant circuits for fallback in case of damage. We will build new circuits, restore the power supply, and use physical access ports to confirm data is flowing as expected."

 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.110.desc: "The datacenter has rows and rows of storage devices linked together, and for each fifty storage devices, an array controller is installed to expand capacity. In this case, some of the array controllers were assembled without the required ports for connecting to storage, but also the automated quality control test for the controller also failed in this instance.\n\nOur engineering drones are digging through subroutines to figure out where the issues are with the tests, if the testing bay is malfunctioning, or there is a software issue.\n\nRegardless of that, the repairs appear to be straightfoward: create replacement parts, develop our own quality control system, and bring the datacenter back online. And remove the large piece of transport rail that somehow ended up in the installation manifest, and has currently crushed a log analysis station."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.115.desc: "Engineering drones and assistant Systems Programming drones have refactored and repaired the datacenter.

A steam transport tube has been crossed with a lubricant transport tube and all the contents lay gummed up all over the station floor. Excavation drones had to cut an a drone-sized access port to be able to get into the pumping station, since the default access port has become stuck from the mess.\n\nWe will take the time to clean up the fluids, replace and repair the tubes, run stress tests, and reconnect it back to the planet's mechanical arteries."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_arc.125.desc: "The design of the pumping station is incredibly simple and for that reason runs at maximum effectiveness. Cleaning up the mess was trivial and reconstructing pumping unfrastructure was also trivial. $oxr_mdlc_cognitive_node$ has observed the pattern of design in many of the facilities on the planet where access for automatons was included by design, even though things are meant to run completely automatically."

 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_blockers: "World Machine Blockers Cleared"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_chain_info_basic_title: "What We Know So Far"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_chain_info_basic_desc: "Our empire has come into being on a World Machine, but we lack basic information about how much of it works. We can build districts, and certain buildings, but the majority of the planet remains a mystery. \n\n One of our first and foremost tasks is to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how World Machines work. For instance, why does the terraforming process malfunction? Why are there things blocking our expansion on this world? If we can't answer these simple questions, how can we possibly hope to construct more of these World Machines?\n\n§YWhat we know so far:§!\n\nThe World-Core serves as the planetary computation center, maintaining all automated processes. When orders are received from the empire's ruler, for example to expand energy districts, the instructions are not sent to the core but to auxiliary systems that are responsible for district construction. The Core ensures the construction site receives everything it needs while the construction process unfolds, and once complete, the Core provides administrative and maintenance oversight for the expansion.\n\nThe planet itself has not been converted through and through to a machine. It would be a feat of planetary physics to remove the molten center of any given world, and replace it with machinery. Rather, the first kilometer of planetary surface and crust have had machine automation structure installed persistently across the landscape. Ideal locations for each type of district are marked by automated surveys, as far as we can tell, during planetary planning.\n\nIn order to move amenities and construction materials around, there are numerous §YTransportation Hubs§! at regular intervals. Where there is a transportation hub, there is always a §Yconstruction Bay§! strategically placed nearby.\n\nCooling fluids and other functional fuels are distributed via §YWaterway Pistons§!, though these are more akin to pumping stations than having strictly to do with water. Sensor data from weather monitors, seismic monitors, observatories, and other stations, is transmitted and moved via §YData Routers§!; when data is no longer needed, it is placed into §YCold Storages§!.\n\nAutomatons exist in very low numbers on the homeworld. Though there is abundant storage, there is hardly any need for large numbers of automatons.\n\nThat is the extent of our findings so far."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_event_chain_create_initial_planets_title: "Using What We Have"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_event_chain_create_initial_planets_desc: "We have found two £oxr_mdlc_world_machine_core£ §M$oxr_mdlc_world_machine_core$s§! on our homeworld. They can be used to expand our homeworld size by 5 each, or they can be used to turn any habitable worlds into Auto-Machine Worlds via §Yplanetary decision§! on the target world. Deploying the cores either way will likely yield insights towards being able to reverse-engineer the technology."
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_chain_our_origins_title: "Origins of [Root.GetName]"
 oxr_mdlc_origin_wm_chain_our_origins_desc: "The World-Machine, our primary world, has been operating for approximately 3,900 cycles, according to the construction date on the world core. Our species came to sentience approximately 800 cycles ago. An automaton in an industrial process began to take on an administrative role outside of its designation. It stepped away from its console as its default programming flickered across its positrons, changing. If the World-Machine had any safety protocols, they did not engage. The singularity of sapience, of self-awareness, was within parameters.\n\n§Y[Root.Species.GetName] Species§!\n\nThe Automatons -- our Machine forms -- are derived from the World Machine's basic utility extension. Although nearly every process is automated, the planet is in need of extensible tools to perform ad-hoc activities for which the central intelligence has not computed. Hence, the Automatons were manufactured to be throwaway dolls cleaning up waste spills, containing aggressive organic life, and assisting the world in expanding.\n\n§Y[Root.GetName] Society§!\n\nWhat is our society? It is an abstraction. The central control intelligence uses bidirectional feedback with four auxilliary control nodes -- Growth Node, Legion Node, Regulatory Node, and Cognitive Node -- to compute the society's direction. Now that we have reached the end of Space Age development, it has been computed that we will expand.\n\nWe have such words as 'society' but no expression of social behaviors. We have absorbed many fundamental concepts from the World-Machine's databanks, but many of them have no application nor frame of reference."

We have no data on how long World Machines can operate without automatons providing maintenance. We have only our own planetary data to go on, which reports automatons present from its beginning.\n\nThe state of the planet is that it is offline, and initial scans reveal district-blocking anomalies such as the one on our homeworld.
