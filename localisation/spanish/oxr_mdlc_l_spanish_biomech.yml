#  OXR_MDLC_BIO_MECH_WORLD_PLANETFORMS_2_DESC: "We will study our very first bio-mechanical building and assess its potential. It will be closely monitored for stability and durability."
#  OXR_MDLC_BIO_MECH_WORLD_PLANETFORMS_3: "Study Unstable Cloned Building"
#  OXR_MDLC_BIO_MECH_WORLD_PLANETFORMS_3_DESC: "There must be an explanation for why the bio-mechanical building changed its configuration, without any apparent input from us. Researchers will perform a full analysis of the synthetic cloning protocol, materials involved, weather patterns, and any other possible environmental factors."
