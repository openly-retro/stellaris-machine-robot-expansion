# rikk_mdlc_tech_world_machine_inner_core_upgrade_desc: "The core of a planet is a special place. It is where the gravitic and electromagnetic fields start and end. It is the cradle of the hottest and heaviest materials on the planet. We will be able to abuse both of these to our best of our abilities."
