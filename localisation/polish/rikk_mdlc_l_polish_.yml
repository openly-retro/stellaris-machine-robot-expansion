 rikk_mdlc_zone_cooling_towers_desc: "These crystal-structured towers scrape the upper edges of the atmosphere, dispersing heat through a mix of exotic gases that form a cloud layer that disperses heat away from the surface of the planet. Once the gases have radiated their heat, they cool into fluid and rain down on the surface; special collectors drain the fluids and prepare them to be dispersed into the atmosphere again through mote-based heat recyclers."
