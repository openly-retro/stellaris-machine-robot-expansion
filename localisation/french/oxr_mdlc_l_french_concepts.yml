# Instructions:
# 1. Add your concept entry like 'concept_<author_tag>_mdlc_<the_concept>'

#   named the same as the loc, IF you want the concept to work in-game
#   you can add text here first, and content to game_concepts when you are ready
# 3. Re-sort the section you added to, ALPHABETICALLY ASCENDING
