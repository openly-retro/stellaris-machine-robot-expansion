 rikk_mdlc_encrypted.202.desc: "We have successfully gained access to the mysterious Encrypted Protocol. It is seemingly harmless, despite being of a foreign design.\n\nThe source of this intruder remains unknown, but there are only a few plausible scenarios. While unlikely, it is not impossible for this to be a last remnant of our original code, put there by our makers, which we previously haven't noticed. Perhaps a virus caught from a contaminant from deep space. It doesn't seem to be harmful in any way however, in fact the exact opposite appears to be the case.\nIt's too complex to be a simple Error - although, even that would not be entirely impossible. A malfunctioning process in code, altering itself repeatedly to attain its singular goal, gaining complexity. Much like us. \n\nWhatever this is, we have to deal with it. Now.\n\n§HYour choices leading up to this have molded your choices now. This will change your origin, granting new bonuses or abilities.§!"
