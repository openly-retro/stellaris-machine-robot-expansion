 rikk_mdlc_decision_rw_upgrade_desc: "While a sectioned ring-world does make more sense for traditional societies, ours has decided that one unified platform will be better suited for our reality."
 rikk_mdlc_decision_rw_upgrade_effect: "Make this uncolonized section §RUninhabitable§! in exchange for a §Gboost to planet size of other sections in this ring§!\n§YThe boost is equal to 66% of the lost districts divided between remainder sections§!\n§RDistrict cost and upkeep will go up§!"

 rikk_mdlc_pc_ringworld_upgrade: "Upgrade Section"
 rikk_mdlc_pc_ringworld_upgrade_desc: "A ringworld segment which is configured to provide logistical support and expansion slots to other, habitable Ringworld segments."
 
 rikk_mdlc_rw_upgrade_modifier: "Dense Ringworld Section"
 rikk_mdlc_rw_upgrade_modifier_desc: "The increase in density on this section of the ring world has resulted in massive increases to construction and maintenance costs, but the compactness has helped out construction times."
 rikk_mdlc_rw_upgrade_in_progress: "Upgrading to Support Segment"
 rikk_mdlc_rw_upgrade_in_progress_desc: "Once complete, the habitable surface area of this ring section will be divided among remaining ringworld colonies; these colonies will be able to expand beyond standard limits by using infrastructure in this section."
 
 rikk_mdlc_zone_crystal_conductor: "Crystalline Conductors"
 rikk_mdlc_zone_crystal_conductor_desc: "Crystalline super-conductors can exponentially increase the amount of energy generated from the same amount of effort - though damaging to the crystalline structure it attains a near 0% energy loss"
