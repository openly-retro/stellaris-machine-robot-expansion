 # Fun stuff for the future
 oxr_mdlc_bio_pop_drink: "Bio-Pop Drink"
 oxr_mdlc_bio_pop_drink_desc: "Is it soda? Is it sentient? Whatever it is, you can be sure it's organic. Enjoy a sip of superior flavor anywhere, any time. All of our sustainably sourced ingredients are cold pressed, whether they like it or not.\n\n§PDisclaimer: Bio Pop's claims have not been reviewed by the Galcom Food & Drug Administration.§!\n\n§LIngredients: 100% fresh squeezed Bio Matter (tm), Tiyanki extract, Benzoic acid, elderberries, Natural flavors.§!"

 oxr_mdlc_trashbot_garbage: "Galactic Garbage"
 oxr_mdlc_trashbot_garbage_desc: "10 metrics tons of universal unrefined garbage: geological matter, construction materials, organic matter, random space debris, ship scraps. Everything and anything, and sometimes, anyone."

 oxr_mdlc_trashbot_sludge_pop: "Sludge Pop"
 oxr_mdlc_trashbot_sludge_pop_desc: "Arguably refreshing, arguably food, but what's uncontestable is it'll fill you up and never let you down. Buy them at a tomb world near you!\n\n§PDisclaimer: Sludge Pop's claims have not been reviewed by the Galcom Food & Drug Administration.§!\n\n§LIngredients: Refined Enriched Bleached Fortified industrial slurry, GFDA Blue No.1 Lake, GFDA Red No.40 Lake, Natural flavors.§!"

 oxr_mdlc_world_core: "Auto-World Core"
 oxr_mdlc_world_core_desc: "A single, self-deploying core able to either independently terraform existing plants into Auto-Machine Worlds, or increase the planet size of an existing Auto-Machine World.\n\n§LThis is a real-world implementation of Fractal Theory.§!"

 ## For Aquatic Pre-FTL origin
 oxr_mdlc_ringwoodite: "Ringwoodite"
 oxr_mdlc_ringwoodite_desc: "A high-pressure phase of magnesium silicate formed at high temperatures and pressures in the mantle of ocean worlds, between 525 and 660 km depth. It is a hexoctahedral crystal, typically blue in color."
 oxr_mdlc_davemite: "Davemite"
 oxr_mdlc_davemite_desc: "Found between about 670 and 2700 km depth in the lower mantle of ocean worlds, it is highly unstable once exposed to pressures less than 40 GPa. It can host various isotopes. It is typically yellow in color."

 ## FAIL TOOLTIPS
 xvcv_mdlc_ap_bio_robot_fail.ai_rights: "If we are to change our bodies into mechanical ones, then, our society must agree first, as a whole, that sentient machines may have full rights."

 ## TRAITS ##
 trait_oxr_mdlc_pc_auto_world_specialist_preference: "Auto-Machine Specialist"
 trait_oxr_mdlc_pc_auto_world_specialist_preference_desc: "This Machine species has been fitted with numerous adapters, a specialized GPS, and additional parts to permit it to function on automated machine worlds, which are not inherently designed to support any processing units outside of itself. Due to this species' specialization, it will have some difficulty adapting to most other types of planets."
