[h1] Acknowledgements [/h1]
This mod is a continuation of XVCV's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441507863] "Machines & Robot Expansion" [/url], which is/was loved by many. A great addon for Machine empire enthusiasts which I loved playing.

Unfortunately, since XVCV has left the Stellaris modding scene, the M&RE mod became unsupported.

This adaptation/continuation will continue to make the Machine & Robot Expansion compatible with the latest versions of Stellaris. In addition to bug fixes, new things are being planned!

[h1] Compatibility [/h1]
- Works with Stellaris 3.10 and 3.11
- Players on 3.10 will see trait tooltips from 3.11, so some won't be accurate for 3.10.

[h1] Core features of Machine & Robot Expansion [/h1]
- Assemble machine leaders using a unique GUI interface
- Alter the machine ruler's consciousness, add or remove traits as desired with a GUI interface
- Inhabited worlds can be converted to "Auto-Machine worlds" which don't need pops to run, and have three major specializations
- Ascend to a new bio-mechanical hybrid species
- Declare total war on the galaxy -- Machines rule! Or instigate Machine Uprisings.. 
- Expand machine empire economy with a Merchant Machine civic -- create trade routes that produce value!
- New machine & robot traits
- Unplug from the unified machine consciousness, and give unique personalities to all machine citizens
- Attune to the psychic world with new APs
- Several new Ascension Perks
- New civics
- New traits

[h1] DLC Requirements [/h1]

Requires Synthetic Dawn and Galactic Paragons.

I will do my best to make sure no further DLCs are required as more content is added to this mod.

Players may see some traits available in the leader-builder and core-modifying GUI that are restricted to certain DLCs.

Two of the origins provided by this mod require Utopia.

[h1]About this re-release[/h1]

*****************************
* THIS IS A BETA RELEASE  *
*****************************

Some things may not work as expected, but most things are working. Expect some missing tooltips, and some bugs here and there as I work things out.

This re-release is a serious effort to bring this mod back up to speed to work with 3.10 and beyond, as well as beginning to address bugs with the existing features that made the mod exciting. A lot of work had to be done behind the scenes.

Mainly the biggest effort was addressing all the traits in the leader-building and core intelligence modifying features. The traits, tooltips, and such all became outdated. Likewise, 3.10 brought new leader subclasses with the Paragons DLC, and tons of new traits that ended up replacing a lot of the 3.9 traits in addition to simply adding more to the menu.

I've spent a lot of time writing scripts to generate a lot of localisations, button effects, and GUI code for traits.
No human being should be made to do all that by hand. If Stellaris changes traits or adds more, it won't be an issue to maintain this mod. This also opens up the possibility to easily add other mods' traits to this one!
