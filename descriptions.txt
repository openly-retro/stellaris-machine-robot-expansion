[h1] Stellaris v3.12.* Compatible [/h1]

[h1] Acknowledgements [/h1]
This mod is a continuation of XVCV's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441507863] "Machines & Robot Expansion" [/url], which is/was loved by many. A great addon for Machine empire enthusiasts which I loved playing.

Unfortunately, since XVCV has left the Stellaris modding scene, the M&RE mod became unsupported.

This adaptation/continuation will continue to make the Machine & Robot Expansion compatible with the latest versions of Stellaris. In addition to bug fixes, new things are being planned!

[h2] Future DLC requirements [/h2]

I will do my best to make sure no further DLCs are **required** as more content is added to this mod.

But some DLCs provide new things for modders to play with and as such some additional mod features may depend on those DLCs.
