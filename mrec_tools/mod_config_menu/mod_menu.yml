    description: These options fire events that do various cleanup and fixes, and are used in cases to help remove objects from mod features that have been removed.
    options:
    - name: Remove Auto-Server deposits from districts
      description: |
        Before district specializations, on World Machines, a system of planetary deposits was used in order to boost non-resource effects like encryption, empire anti-crime, etc. Deposits were the only way at the time we could get country modifiers like naval cap to increase from building a district. Since district specializations have appeared, we don't need to use the deposit system. However, there may be some old deposits on Auto-Server planets that need to be removed.

        Use this option if you have loaded an old save that had an Auto-Server or you notice deposits on the planet that should not be there.
