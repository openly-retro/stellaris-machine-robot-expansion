[h1] More Machine & Robot Trait Picks & Points [/h1]

This mod is intended for use alongside [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3163759042]Machine and Robot Expansion: Continued[/url]. 

This mod increases trait points and picks for [b]Machines and Robots only[/b]. It is necessary since the above mod overwrites the MACHINE archetype and this messes with mods that boost point and picks. So a custom mod like this one is necessary.

[b]This mod does NOT raise trait points and picks for biological species or lithoids.[/b]

[h2]Boost to points and picks [/h2]

[b]Trait points[/b] are increased from [b]1[/b] (base game) to [b]5[/b].

[b]Trait picks[/b] (max traits) are increased from [b]4[/b] (Robots) and [b]5[/b] (Machines) to [b]9[/b] picks each.

This should be on par with other trait point and picks mods for this category.

[h3]Overwrites [/h3]
The file name in species_archetypes that does the overwrite begins with the letter *p*. So ascibetically this means that any points and picks mods whose files start with `z_` will override this mod's versions.

It will just mean that Automaton species on World Machines (from Machine and Robot Expansion: Continued) will have energy upkeep.
