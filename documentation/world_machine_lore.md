## About the `<Player's Empire Name>`

The World-Machine, our primary world, has been operating for approximately 3,900 cycles, according to the construction date on the world core. Our species came to sentience approximately 800 cycles ago. An automaton in an industrial process began to take on an administrative role outside of its designation. It stepped away from its console as its default programming flickered across its positrons, changing. If the World-Machine had any safety protocols, they did not engage. The singularity of sapience, of self-awareness, was within parameters.

The Automatons -- our Machine forms -- are derived from the World Machine's basic utility extension. Although nearly every process is automated, the planet is in need of extensible tools to perform abstract activities for which the central intelligence has not computed. Hence, the Automatons were manufactured to be throwaway dolls cleaning up waste spills, containing aggressive organic life, and assisting the world in expanding.

`<Player's empire's name>` Society§!

What is our society? It is an abstraction. The central control intelligence uses bidirectional feedback with four auxilliary control nodes -- Growth Node, Legion Node, Regulatory Node, and Cognitive Node -- to compute the society's direction. Now that we have reached the end of Space Age development, it has been computed that we will expand.

We have such words as 'society' but no expression of social behaviors. We have absorbed many fundamental concepts from the World-Machine's databanks, but many of them have no application nor frame of reference.

## What we know so far, Part 1

Our empire has come into being on a World Machine, but we lack basic information about how much of it works. We can build districts, and certain buildings, but the majority of the planet remains a mystery. One of our first and foremost tasks is to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how World Machines work. For instance, why does the terraforming process malfunction? Why are there things blocking our expansion on this world? If we can't answer these simple questions, how can we possibly hope to construct more of these World Machines?

What we know so far:

The World-Core serves as the planetary computation center, maintaining all automated processes. When orders are received from the empire's ruler, for example to expand energy districts, the instructions are not sent to the core but to auxiliary systems that are responsible for district construction. The Core ensures the construction site receives everything it needs while the construction process unfolds, and once complete, the Core provides administrative and maintenance oversight for the expansion.

The planet itself has not been converted through and through to a machine. It would be a feat of planetary physics to remove the molten center of any given world, and replace it with machinery. Rather, the first kilometer of planetary surface and crust have had machine automation structure installed persistently across the landscape. Ideal locations for each type of district are marked by automated surveys, as far as we can tell, during planetary planning.

In order to move amenities and construction materials around, there are numerous §YTransportation Hubs§! at regular intervals. Where there is a transportation hub, there is always a §Yconstruction Bay§! strategically placed nearby.

Cooling fluids and other functional fuels are distributed via Waterway Pistons, though these are more akin to pumping stations than having strictly to do with water. Sensor data from weather monitors, seismic monitors, observatories, and other stations, is transmitted and moved via Data Routers; when data is no longer needed, it is placed into Cold Storages.

Automatons exist in very low numbers on the homeworld. Though there is abundant storage, there is hardly any need for large numbers of automatons.

That is the extent of our findings so far.


## World Machine Proficiency: Basic Blockers

Collapsed Charge Controller: These charge controllers direct energy from generators to the vast battery banks distributed around the planet, at strategic points. Some of them have been damaged and must be rebuilt in order to expand generator capacity to maxium.

Fossilized Nutrient Bog: All sorts of biomass has collected here in a colorful mire, some of it growing, some of it decaying, all inconveniently in the way of expanding food harvesting operations.

Flooded Borehole: Automated mining processes have been unable to continue because of a massive liquid breach into the depths of the borehole. Mineral collection cannot continue here.

Clogged Furnace Discharge: The slag conveyance system is a core component of the industrial sector's infrastructure. The prebuilt furnace discharge supporting a future sector has been clogged with slag and must be completely redone.

Irradiated Drone Storage: The structural foundation for the pop storage district has been contaminated with high levels of radioactivity, undoubtedly from a leak in one of the fusion power tubes circulating the planet. The framework will have to be completely excavated and discarded.

World Machine Proficiency: District Blockers

Meteor Shower Impact Site: A meteor shower has broken up the ground here and made it completely unsuitable to build on. However, there are some trace minerals and alloys that may be recovered when our earthworks crews go to level the area.

Collapsed Transportation Hub: A transit hub to permit vehicles and other transports to deliver and ferry cargo and pops is broken, with large sections having fallen down. The physical passageways as well as the information routing stations must be reconstructed.

Exposed Structural Chasm: Where there should be solid ground, instead is a perfectly geometric chasm leading to the planet's core. An imperfection in the world-machine terraforming process simply skipped adding any sort of ground here. We will have to carefully rebuild layers of missing subterranean supports.

Disruptive Geological Mass: There is a large deposit of igneous rock here with compressive strength and tensile strength too strong for the world's automated expansion processes to clear. This area will have to be manually leveled using explosives, but may yield usable resources in the process.


## World Machine Proficiency: Advanced Blockers

Offline Data Router: There are large information infrastructure centers distributed throughout the planet, which extend the range at which data can be transmitted, and provide redundancy for the entire planetary network. One such router is offline, blocking district expansion.

Damaged Cold Storage Datacenter: This datacenter has been taken offline due to significant damage. It contains terabytes of system logs, sensor data, kernel dumpfiles, hardly an exciting trove to wade through. However, the logs give insights as to how the planet's automated systems should operate; We can analyze core dumps here and potentially reverse engineer some of the sensor data to rebuild the vast sensor networks spanning the planet.

Frozen Hydraulic Pistons: The giant heat pumps under the planet's crust whisk away waste heat. This pump design is used not just for waste heat but for distributing lubricants, ultra-high-pressure steam, and virtually every other kind of liquid. In getting this unstuck we may have an opportunity to understand more about the design philosophy of this ubiquitous structure.

Incomplete Construction Bay: Another fundamental aspect of World Machines, automated construction bays are programmed to handle the logicstics of building every type of district and facility. Large self-deploying cranes await assembly; fuel tanks are half-built; materials storages are barren. These bays are scattered throughout the landscape, and are necessary to continue expanding planetary infrastructure.


## World Machine Core: Technology Overview

World Machine Core: The central processing core of an Auto-Machine World planet. The core contains a large reactor, which is estimated to have a lifespan of at least 5,000 years, based on data gathered from the core of our homeworld. It is self-contained, sealed on all sites, with massive conduits plugged into all of its faces, pumping data back and forth between districts, buildings, sensor arrays, and all the infrastructure needed to run automations.with multiple interfaces. It includes smaller-scale digital interfaces for transmitting data, and electronic interfaces for redundant health checks. The core has six large entry and exit ports for high-density cooling fluid.

When a World Machine planet has finished being terraformed, the core is slotted in to a cradle at the end of a kilometers-long shaft extending into the planet’s crust, well out of range of surface attacks but not deep enough to suffer from heat emanating from the planet's center. The core itself cannot be seen from inside the cradle, but lighted control surfaces all over the various faces of the cradle are twinkling with activity. 

In the World Machine Core Fabricator factory, the core is assembled in several stages: Reactor assembly, durable housing, a second housing around it for storing manufacturing equipment and large compacted facilities for printing and assembling all the machinery, forges, pumps, controls, and everything needed for the core to direct planet-wide terraforming.

The core is then powered on in test mode using external high-voltage controls at the manufacturing facility. The boot process has several phases:

Initial power-on: Electricity floods the electronic components, monitoring equipment, voltage control equipment, and the boot logic controller, which then controls startup of additional processes.

Self-Test: All components have self-test protocols and all components must report PASS to the boot logic controller for the system to continue.

Reactor Warm-up: After all control and monitoring stations have reported to be working, the reactor is turned on at minimum power, to allow conduits and conductors to begin to warm up.

Reactor Failure Simulation: A disaster scenario is executed which simulates the reactor failing and going critical. All disaster recovery components are tested and safety protocols are verified.

Reactor Sustained power: The reactor throttle is opened to 50% of capacity and infrastructure continues warming. Cooling systems activate at this point though they are not needed until the reactor reaches 80% capacity.

Reactor Full power: The reactor is pushed to full capacity and run for 3 days at full power.

Reactor Standby and Diagnostics: Data from the power-on is crunched and analyzed. If all data is within normal parameters, the World Machine Core is considered viable and stored in standby mode for planetary deployment. If the parameters are out-of-bounds, a repair plan is drafted and implemented, and the test process is started from the beginning.

## World Machine Core: Terraform Process

The core (fully assembled reactor, housing, electronics, and infrastructure) is deposited on a flat location on the planet, along with a large amount of seed minerals. The core is fed a large amount of energy in order to fire up the reactor to minimum levels and charge secondary capacitors. It is then left to operate independently

The outer shell of the core unfolds and elaborate programs direct the pre-installed printers and fabricators to begin manufacturing Automatons which will further assist the core intelligence in building factories, forges, heavy equipment, depositories, and the like.

The first several months of the planetwide transformation are spent raising forges and assembly plants for producing heavy terraforming machines that flatten and even out land in order to create a stable, orderly plane on which to start delineating districts. The machinery are directed by survey drones around obstacles such as lakes, oceans, canyons, rivers, and create as much flat area as possible. If the canyon or ravine is not too wide, structural frames will be extended across it. 

The initial stockpile of seed minerals are used up, but by this time, new sources of minerals will have already been discovered and exploited on the planet.

The land sculpting can take up to two years with machinery working nonstop, recharging at the core construction yard as needed.

Next, the most suitable locations for each type of district are planned, along with global transportation infrastructure, power transmission stations, data transmission stations, hydraulic piping, pumping stations for various fluids (lubricants, coolants, bio-nutrients and water for farming, heat).

In accordance with the main plan, a location is scouted for a large shaft to be dug into the earth, at the end of which the core will install itself to. The access shaft must not cross water, natural cave systems, or other features that will permit leaks or intrusions.

While the installation shaft is being excavated, shielded tunnel walls are being fabricated and installed. The core remains connected to planetary infrastructure, providing power and instructions to various processes that need them.

Large channels crossing the planet are dug out from the surface, each terminating in the center of each district planning area. All channels connect at some point from pathways connecting to the central core.

By the time the security shaft has been completed, and the core has been lowered down to secure depths, the rest of the planet infrastructure will have been developed simultaneously.

## Converting Unusual Worlds to World-Machines

Several types of planetary bodies do not lend themselves easily to being built on, namely molten worlds, ocean worlds, and frozen worlds.

Molten World Strategy:

(TBD)

Frozen World Strategy:

Frozen worlds are covered in a permanent layer of ice and rock. The amount of ammonia on the planet will determine how low the temperature is and how much of the planet is frozen vs simply extremely cold.

(TBD)

Ocean World Strategy:

Ocean worlds have a surface nearly completely covered in water. A World-Machine core must have a flat surface to work on.
